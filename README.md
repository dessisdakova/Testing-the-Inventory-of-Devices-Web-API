# Testing the Inventory of Devices Web API

## Objective
- Familiarize yourself with a Flask-based web API project.
- Understand the Docker and Docker Compose configuration used in the project.
- Interact with the Inventory of Devices API to understand its functionality.
- Develop test cases for this API (manual testing, no automation required yet).

## Tasks
1. Clone the project repository
	- URL: https://github.com/waad19/mock-api-server

2. Understand Docker and Docker Compose configuration
	- Understand the services defined in docker-compose.yml.</br>
`build: .` - builds the container from the Dockerfile in the same directory.</br>
`container_name: {example name}` - sets the container name.</br>
`depends_on:` - sets dependencies for the container. In this case **tests** container depends on **api-mock** container with </br>
`condition: service_started` - which ensures that **api-mock** container will be running before **tests** container starts.</br>
`environment:` - sets environment variables. It this case *REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE* is set to point to */root/ca/rsa/volumed_dir/full-chain.cert.pem* which tells the requests library in Python to use a custom certificate bundle for SSL verification.</br>
`working_dir: {/example/dir}` - sets the working directory inside the container.</br>
`volumes:`- mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers, shared across containers or saved even if the container is stopped and restarted. In this case *.:/opt/project* allows the container to access the local project files and *api_mock_certs* volume is mounted to the */root/ca/rsa/volumed_dir directory* in both the api-mock and tests containers where the server's certificates are stored.</br>
`entrypoint:` - used to specify programs that execute when a container starts. In this case entrypoint for the container is a *ping* command to the *api-mock-server* container. It will ping the mock server *5* times.</br>
`ports:` - maps port *HOST_PORT*:*CONTAINER_PORT*. In this case port 80 inside the container (the default HTTP port) is mapped to port 8080 on host machine and port 443 inside the container (the default HTTPS port) is mapped to port 8443 on host machine.</br>
`volumes:` section below `services` - defines a volume called *api_mock_certs* that is shared between the **tests** and **api-mock** services.</br>
	- Note how the web server is containerized and how it interacts with other services.
	- Identify the exposed ports and environment variables.
	
3. Set up and run the application
	- Install Docker and Docker Compose if not already installed.
	- Verify the application is running: Use a tool like curl or Postman.

4. Interact with the Inventory of Devices API
	- Identify the available API endpoints related to the inventory of devices.
	- Analyze the request and response formats.

5. Develop test cases for the Inventory of Devices API
	- Write at least 5 test cases.
	- Focus on both positive and negative scenarios. 
	- Consider edge cases and input validation, if applicable.
	- Test case format.
